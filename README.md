[Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) are Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data � think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler. 

```Byndyusoft.Net.Http.Formatting.ProtoBuf``` actually depends on ```Microsoft.Net.Http```, and extends the ```HttpClient``` with ```Protocol Buffers```
features that you would likely need to talk to a RESTful service such as ASP.NET Web API.

Package operates in the ```System.Net.Http``` namespace and adds some handy extension methods to ```HttpClient``` and ```HttpContent```.

So for example:

```
using (var client = new HttpClient())
{
    client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Add(new MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue("application/protobuf"));
    var response = await client.GetAsync("http://localhost/api/products/1");
    response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
    var product = await response.Content.ReadAsAsync<ProductInfo>(new[]
            {
                new ProtoBufMediaTypeFormatter()
            });
}
```

If you tried to just use ```Microsoft.Net.Http```, the ```ReadAsAsync``` method wouldn't be available to you, and you'd only be able to read the content 
as raw data such as bytes or string, and have to do the serializing / de-serializing yourself.

You also get extension methods to PUT / POST back to the service in ```ProtoBuf``` format without having to do that yourself:

```
// Save the ProductInfo model back to the API service
await client.PutAsProtoBufAsync("http://localhost/api/products/1", product);
await client.PostAsProtoBufAsync("http://localhost/api/products/1", product);
```
